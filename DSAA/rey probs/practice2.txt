Create a 2 queue, one is for binary numbers whose decimal values are prime, one queue are decimal numbers that are composite. The program will determine where the numbers should be queued.

The program will create a choice on what number to pin, meaning if the number is chosen it will be moved at the last and considered first to view. 

The program will automatically determine, if the number to pin, is on the first queue or second queue. 

The queue is from last to first view.

Example assuming that the numbers are already queued individually: 

Queue A: 0011 1011 0101
Queue B: 20 16 48 

Pin 16

Queue A: 0011 1011 0101 
Queue B: 16 20 48 

Pin 0101

Queue A: 0101 0011 1011
Queue B: 16 20 48
