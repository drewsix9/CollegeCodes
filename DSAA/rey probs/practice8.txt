Problem: Unique Characters in Linked List

Given a linked list of strings, determine if each string in the list contains only unique characters. Return a new linked list where each node contains a boolean value indicating whether the corresponding string in the original linked list has unique characters or not.

For example, given the linked list:

Input: "hello" -> "world" -> "openai" -> "unique"

The expected output would be:

Output: true -> false -> true -> true

Explanation:

The string "hello" contains duplicate characters ('l'), so the corresponding boolean value is false.
The string "world" contains duplicate characters ('o'), so the corresponding boolean value is false.
The string "openai" contains only unique characters, so the corresponding boolean value is true.
The string "unique" contains only unique characters, so the corresponding boolean value is true.
