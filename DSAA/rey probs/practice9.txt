Problem: Unique Strings in Linked List

You are given a linked list of strings. Your task is to implement a function that removes all duplicate strings from the linked list, keeping only the unique strings. The function should return the resulting linked list.

Test Case:

Input:

Linked List: "apple" -> "banana" -> "apple" -> "orange" -> "banana"
Expected Output:

Unique Linked List: "apple" -> "banana" -> "orange"
In this test case, the input linked list contains duplicate strings ("apple" and "banana"). The expected output is a linked list that retains only the unique strings, removing the duplicates.
