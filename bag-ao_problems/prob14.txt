Write a C program that takes an array of strings as input and checks if each string contains a given substring. (better if dynamically allocated ang array of strings).

Here's an example of what your program's output should look like:

enter number of strings: 3

Input array of strings:
string1: Hello world
string2: How are you today?
string3: I'm doing well, thank you.

substring: "you"

Output:
The substring "you" was NOT found in string "Hello world".
The substring "you" was found in string "How are you today?" at index: 8
The substring "you" was found in string "I'm doing well, thank you." at index: 22


Note that the output should indicate which strings contain the substring, which ones do not and at which index was the substring found.Good luck!
