Write a C program that takes an array of strings as input and finds the string with the highest number of distinct words. Your program should output the string with the highest number of distinct words and the number of distinct words.

For example, if the input array of strings is {"the quick brown fox", "the lazy dog", "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"}, the string with the highest number of distinct words is "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", which has 8 distinct words ("the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "lazy", and "dog"). Your program should output "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and "8".

the quick brown fox
the lazy dog
the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
