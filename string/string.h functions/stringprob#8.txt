Write a C program that takes an array of strings as input and finds the string with the highest number of non-repeating characters. Your program should output the string with the highest number of non-repeating characters and the number of non-repeating characters.

For example, if the input array of strings is {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"}, the string with the highest number of non-repeating characters is "cherry", which has 5 non-repeating characters ("c", "h", "e", "r", and "y"). Your program should output "cherry" and "5".

apple
banana
cherry
date

apple
