Write a C program that takes an array of strings and a substring as input and finds the number of occurrences of the substring in each string. Your program should output the number of occurrences of the substring in each string.
For example, if the input array of strings is {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"} and the substring is "a", the number of occurrences of the substring in each string is 1, 3, 1, and 1, respectively. Your program should output "1 3 1 1".

apple
banana
cherry
date

apple banana cherry date
a
