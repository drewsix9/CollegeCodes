In AVL tree rotations, we determine whether a subtree is in a Left-Left (LL), Right-Right (RR), Left-Right (LR), or Right-Left (RL) imbalance based on the structure and balance factors of the nodes involved.

In an AVL tree, each node has a balance factor associated with it, which represents the difference in height between its left and right subtrees. The balance factor can be -1, 0, or 1, indicating whether the subtree is balanced, leaning to the left, or leaning to the right, respectively.

When performing rotations to rebalance the tree, we consider the balance factors of three nodes: the pivot node (the node being rotated), its left child (if it exists), and its right child (if it exists). Here's how we determine the imbalance type:

1. LL Imbalance:
   - The pivot node has a balance factor of 2 (leaning to the right).
   - The left child of the pivot node has a balance factor of 1 (also leaning to the right).

2. RR Imbalance:
   - The pivot node has a balance factor of -2 (leaning to the left).
   - The right child of the pivot node has a balance factor of -1 (also leaning to the left).

3. LR Imbalance:
   - The pivot node has a balance factor of 2 (leaning to the right).
   - The left child of the pivot node has a balance factor of -1 (leaning to the left).

4. RL Imbalance:
   - The pivot node has a balance factor of -2 (leaning to the left).
   - The right child of the pivot node has a balance factor of 1 (leaning to the right).

Note that these conditions are specific to AVL tree rotations. In other types of self-balancing trees, such as Red-Black trees, the imbalance types and conditions may be different.
