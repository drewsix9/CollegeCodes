Collatz sequence: The Collatz sequence is a sequence of positive integers 
that starts with any positive integer and repeatedly applies a simple rule: 
if the number is even, divide it by 2, 
and if it is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. 
The conjecture that every starting number eventually reaches 1 is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics.
